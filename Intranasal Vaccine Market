Frequently Asked Questions
1. What is an intranasal vaccine? An intranasal vaccine is administered through the nose, offering a non-invasive and convenient alternative to injectable vaccines.

2. How does an intranasal vaccine work? Intranasal vaccines stimulate an immune response by delivering the vaccine directly to the mucosal membranes in the nose, which can trigger systemic immunity.

3. What are the advantages of intranasal vaccines? The main advantages include ease of administration, no need for needles, and potentially higher compliance rates, especially among children and elderly individuals.

4. Are there any side effects associated with intranasal vaccines? Side effects are generally mild and can include irritation in the nasal passage, headache, or congestion, similar to other vaccine types.

5. How are intranasal vaccines administered? Intranasal vaccines are typically administered as a spray or drop into the nostrils, where they are absorbed by the mucosal membrane.

6. Which diseases can intranasal vaccines prevent? Intranasal vaccines can prevent diseases such as influenza, COVID-19, and other respiratory infections.

7. How does an intranasal vaccine compare to injectable vaccines? Intranasal vaccines offer a needle-free method, making them more appealing to people with needle aversions and reducing the fear of injections.

8. Are intranasal vaccines safe for children? Yes, intranasal vaccines are safe for children, and they are an ideal option due to ease of administration and better compliance compared to injections.

9. Will the market for intranasal vaccines continue to grow? Yes, the market for intranasal vaccines is expected to grow due to advancements in vaccine technology and increasing demand for needle-free vaccination options.

10. What are the main challenges facing the intranasal vaccine market? Some challenges include regulatory hurdles, limited availability of approved products, and the need for improved storage and stability of intranasal vaccine formulations.
